                <p>
                    This is the last self-directed, larger-scale, full-stack
                    application that you'll build in this course. Up to this
                    point you've learned and practiced everything you need to
                    know in order to build beautiful, data-driven web
                    applications that can provide a real benefit to users. This
                    will be a chance for you to continue to refine your skills,
                    and possibly build something you could turn into a helpful
                    tool for your friends and family, or possibly even a
                    profitable business!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will have this whole week to work on this project of
                    your choosing.

                <h3>Note for Portfolio Project Consideration</h3>

                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>
                    This project offers a valuable opportunity to showcase your
                    skills and achievements, making it an excellent addition to
                    your resume or portfolio.
                </p>

                <h4>Deployment Consideration</h4>
                <p>
                    To ensure compliance with deployment requirements and
                    facilitate effective management of your project, it's
                    advisable to create a dedicated repository. This allows for
                    easy access and organization, whether deploying during the
                    course or upon completion.
