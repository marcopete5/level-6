                <h3>Creating a Software Engineer Portfolio</h3>
                <p>
                    Your portfolio will be a dedicated website that highlights
                    and demonstrates your strengths and abilities as a web
                    developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this assignment, you can use any web development
                    technologies you'd like. And, not to worry, you won't have
                    to code your portfolio from scratch! In fact, that's not a
                    good use of your valuable time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Start <em>very</em> basic</strong>. Resist the
                    temptation to add a lot of bells and whistles right up
                    front. Just because you <em>can</em> doesn't mean you
                    <em>should</em>.
                    <strong>CLEAR over cute or clever</strong> will always win
                    the day so keep it simple. Hiring managers simply need to be
                    able to glean basic information about you and see your
                    skills in action quickly and easily.
                    <strong
                        >Make the path to hiring you as simple and clean as
                        possible</strong
                    >.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Creating a <strong>minimal</strong>,
                    <strong>well-designed website</strong> that contains your
                    <strong>primary</strong> important information
                    <strong></strong>is more than sufficient in order to pass
                    this assignment and get hired. Don’t forget that you can
                    always fine-tune it once you’re in Stage 2 as well.

                <h3>Basic Dos and Don'ts of a Portfolio</h3>
                <h4>Do:</h4>
                <ul class="custom-list">
                    <li>
                        Use a nice font that is subtle and classy. Something
                        like
                        <a
                            href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto"
                            target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener"
                            >Roboto</a
                        >
                        from Google Fonts
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Take the edge off the stark white background by changing
                        the color to something subtle and neutral, like a very
                        <em>very</em> light gray (See the
                        <code>whitesmoke</code> CSS color for an example)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Take the edge off the sharp black text by lightening it
                        a bit, like a very <em>very</em> dark gray.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use very subtle transitions if you decide to include
                        them. Nothing should be jarring or move a whole lot on
                        the page
                    </li>
                    <li>Stick to one or two fonts at most</li>
                    <li>
                        List the languages and technologies you've used
                        (<code>JavaScript</code>, <code>React</code>,
                        <code>Git</code>, <code>JSON Web Tokens</code>,
                        <code>Express</code>, <code>MongoDB</code>,
                        <code>Node.js</code>, <code>HTML Canvas</code>, etc.)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Don't:</h4>
                <ul class="custom-list">
                    <li>
                        Use a silly, childish, busy, or unprofessional font.
                    </li>
                    <li>Use sharp or heavily contrasted colors.</li>
                    <li>
                        Use multiple font families in the same type of text.
                        (Different fonts for different paragraphs, i.e.)
                    </li>
                    <ul class="custom-list">
                        <li>
                            At most, have one font family for headers and
                            another for paragraph text
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Put long paragraphs. No one will read them.</li>
                    <li>
                        Tell your story of being a total beginner programmer or
                        your journey that led you to want to code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Put a chart indicating your level of proficiency in a
                        given language or technology (80% in <code>CSS</code>,
                        85% in <code>JavaScript</code>, etc.).
                    </li>
                    <li>List the editor or IDE you use.</li>

                <p>
                    Your main focus is going to be showcasing your skills
                    through your body of work so you can get an amazing job so
                    using a framework or pre-made template is just great! Here
                    are a few resources that will help you
                    <strong>get a head-start</strong> on your portfolio website
                    and <strong>speed up development time</strong>.

                <h4>CSS Frameworks for Layouts & Styling:</h4>
                <p>
                    Laying out your elements and making them sit correctly on
                    any screen size can be especially frustrating and
                    time-consuming. Consider using a simple, responsive
                    framework that takes care of that for you.
                </p>
                <ol class="custom-list">
                    <li>

                        is a CSS library that only consists of classes, so none
                        of your HTML is impacted by it. You'll have to use the
                        classes in the library to apply any of the styling,
                        which makes it easy to take only what you want from the
                        library, and customize the rest.

                        also allows you to choose the parts that you want, such
                        as the grid framework without importing everything.
